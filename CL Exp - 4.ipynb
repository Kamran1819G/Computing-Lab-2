        "**Theory**: Regular expressions, often abbreviated as regex or regexp, are powerful tools for text processing and pattern matching in Python. They provide a concise and flexible means to search, match, and manipulate strings based on specific patterns. Python's `re` module is the primary library for working with regular expressions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Basics of Regular Expressions**\n",
        "\n",
        "A regular expression is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern. Here are some fundamental concepts:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Literal Characters: Literal characters match themselves. For example, the regex `python` will match the string \"python\" in a text.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "import re\n",
        "\n",
        "pattern = re.compile(r'python')\n",
        "result = pattern.search('I love Python programming')\n",
        "print(result.group())  # Output: Python\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Metacharacters: Metacharacters have special meanings in regex. Some common metacharacters include:\n",
        "\n",
        "- `.` (dot): Matches any character except a newline.\n",
        "- `^`: Anchors the regex at the start of the string.\n",
        "- `$`: Anchors the regex at the end of the string.\n",
        "- `*`: Matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding character.\n",
        "- `+`: Matches one or more occurrences of the preceding character.\n",
        "- `?`: Matches zero or one occurrence of the preceding character.\n",
        "- `[]`: Defines a character class, matches any one of the characters inside the brackets.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Quantifiers: Quantifiers define the number of occurrences of a character or group. Examples include:\n",
        "\n",
        "- `{n}`: Matches exactly n occurrences.\n",
        "- `{n,}`: Matches n or more occurrences.\n",
        "- `{n, m}`: Matches between n and m occurrences.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "pattern = re.compile(r'\\d{3}-\\d{2}-\\d{4}')  # Matches a Social Security Number\n",
        "result = pattern.search('My SSN is 123-45-6789')\n",
        "print(result.group())  # Output: 123-45-6789\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Character Classes: Character classes define a set of characters. They are specified using square brackets `[]`.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "pattern = re.compile(r'[aeiou]')  # Matches any vowel\n",
        "result = pattern.findall('Hello World')\n",
        "print(result)  # Output: ['e', 'o', 'o']\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Escape Characters: To match a metacharacter as a literal, precede it with a backslash `\\`.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "pattern = re.compile(r'\\$')  # Matches the dollar sign\n",
        "result = pattern.search('The price is $20')\n",
        "print(result.group())  # Output: $\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Advanced Usage**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Groups and Capturing: Use parentheses to create groups. Groups can be used for capturing and referencing matched portions of the input.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "pattern = re.compile(r'(\\d+)-(\\w+)')\n",
        "result = pattern.search('123-abc')\n",
        "print(result.group(1))  # Output: 123\n",
        "print(result.group(2))  # Output: abc\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Lookahead and Lookbehind: Lookahead and lookbehind assertions allow you to match a group of characters only if they are followed or preceded by another group.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "pattern = re.compile(r'\\d+(?=%)')  # Matches digits followed by %\n",
        "result = pattern.search('Price: $50%')\n",
        "print(result.group())  # Output: 50\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Flags: The `re` module provides flags that modify the behavior of the regex. Common flags include `re.IGNORECASE` for case-insensitive matching and `re.MULTILINE` for multiline matching.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "pattern = re.compile(r'apple', re.IGNORECASE)\n",
        "result = pattern.search('I love Apple products')\n",
        "print(result.group())  # Output: Apple\n",
        "```\n"
